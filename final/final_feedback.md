# Feedback on Final

Your final project didn't have any specific applicability to the healthcare space and drew some shallow conclusions rather than really digging into the data to try to show a pattern or insight of particular importance. Your work did demonstrate your Python skills, though.

It's unclear to me why you're merging these dataframes together.

Remember that while using functions is helpful, using functions that just do what another function already does is not helpful.  For example, your `remove_column` function does nothing more than `df.drop...`

Your documentation throughout did describe why you were doing, but not why those steps were necessary to getting to a final conclusion.
